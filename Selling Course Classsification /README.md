Graduates of the World of Code business school have turned to you for help. They've created the DigitalEdu Advanced Training Center, which has been successfully selling courses for several years. 
Over time, a problem has arisen: through advertising, they are able to attract a lot of users to their portal, but many of them don't buy any of the courses offered on the site. So money is being spent on advertising, but they aren't making a profit. 
They need to classify the users in order to select those who are more likely to show interest in their courses and target them with advertising. 
While working on the case, you need to identify the clients who are most likely to buy a programming course. 
DigitalEdu is providing us with data from its website about registered users whom they sent advertising to, and who bought or did not buy a course. Based on this data, you will need to build and train a model.
