## _APPLICATION OF THE CONTINUOUS MARKOV MODEL IN DETERMINING SPECIFIED DISEASE INSURANCE PREMIUMS FOR TUBERCULOSIS PATIENT_
_The risk of disease can strike at any time, anywhere, and affect anyone. One such illness is tuberculosis, a contagious disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Treating TB demands considerable financial resources and time. Therefore, health insurance is crucial to cover the financial risks associated with such diseases. Specified disease insurance is a type of coverage that addresses all treatment risks for a specific illness, including tuberculosis. The premium calculation for specified disease insurance for tuberculosis patients is based on a multi-status model, comprising four status categories: healthy, respiratory tuberculosis, tuberculosis of other organs, and die. The multi-status model is formulated by defining these four status categories and determining the transitional movements of tuberculosis patients. Transition intensities are estimated by modeling the movement of TB patients as a Poisson process using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). The intensity of transitions is influenced by the number of transitions made by participants and the total time spent in a status category before transitioning. The transition probabilities, used to determine the likelihood of moving from one status to another, are found by solving the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation. These transition probabilities are influenced by time and transition intensities. The single premium payments in the simulations with a fixed interest rate decrease with the age of the covered person. The magnitude of the single premium is affected by the transition probabilities associated with each status transition._
